# Project: Library

## This project is part of The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript Course.

### The project

The aim of this project is to make a fully functional book library site that is able to take in user's inputs (books info), then add them to the book library.

When users click the "+ ADD BOOK" button, a dialog pops up and let the user to key in "Title", "Author", "Total Pages" and wether or not they have read it (It can be updated later). The user then can press the "ADD" button in the modal to add book, or press the "CANCEL" button or press "ESC" on their keyboard to cancel the operation and close the modal.

Once the user has inputted the new book and pressed "ADD", the book info will display on the page.

Users can change their reading status on the page. A delete button also available next to the book to allow users to delete the book.

### HTML

The HTML is very barebone in this project. It contains two dialogs, one of them has a form with two buttons; and the other one shows an error message and a button.

#### Accessibilty
When I was working on this project, I intended to make it as accessible to all users as possible. I wanted to make sure that I use the right HTML tags, tried not to over-write default HTML functionality and made use of tags that enhance accessibility.

I also make this site responsive to different screen sizes
